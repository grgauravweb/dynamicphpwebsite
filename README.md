# dynamicphpwebsite
Hello there this is Gaurav Rai here. I have made this fully responsive and dynamic website.
Steps to run this project in your system.
1. Download this file in your htdocs folder which is in the xampp folder (you have to download xampp in your system).
2. Now go to localhost/phpmyadmin and export amanroofingworks.sql. It will create database name amanroofingworks and some table name admin, card_img, gallery, profile, query.
3. Go to localhost/test to see your project.
4. Go to localhost/test/admin and login there with aman as username and aman@123 as password.
5. After login successfully you will see a basic admin panel where you can add, view and delete some basic things in your website.
